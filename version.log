fithic_1.0.8.tgz - 12/11/2017 #Thank you to Ye Zheng for bringing
                                this to our attention!
-------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
1. Isotonic regression is now strictly antitonic. 
~~~During the spline fit phase of fithic, we are looking to smooth
the contacts to a monotonically decreasing function. Previously,
the IsotonicRegression function from sklearn was not making this
assumption, and was empirically determining if the function
was isotonic(increasing) or antitonic(decreasing). While it would
typically determine it is antitonic and proceed normally, Ye found
a case where the function determined the flip (isotonic) and this
led to significant influences on fithic's 'significant contacts' 
determination. 

It should be obvious when this has occured, as the
results would be significantly different; however, it is still 
recommended all users update ASAP.
